# Weather Report  🌤️

## The Problem
Weather information is often dull or confusing, making it hard for people to decide what to wear or stay informed about health and safety.

## The Solution
Our weather app is a modern, interactive weather application that transforms complex weather data into actionable insights. Our app provides:

- **Visual Weather Experience**: Beautiful animations and intuitive icons that bring weather to life
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Get outfit suggestions and activity recommendations based on current and forecasted conditions
- **Comprehensive Forecasts**: Detailed hourly and 7-day forecasts with all the metrics you need
- **Health & Safety Insights**: UV index, air quality, and precipitation probabilities to help you plan your day safely
- **Smart Presentation**: Clean, easy-to-understand interface that presents weather data in a way that's actually useful

## Tech Stack

- **React 19.2.0** - Modern React with hooks for state management
- **OpenWeatherMap API** - Real-time weather data and forecasts
- **CSS3** - Custom animations and responsive design
- **Create React App** - Fast development setup and build optimization

## Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- OpenWeatherMap API key ([Get one free here](https://openweathermap.org/api))

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/slumpshouse/Weather-Report-nya.git
   cd Weather-Report-nya
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up your API key**
   
   Create a `.env` file in the project root:
   ```bash
   REACT_APP_WEATHER_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

4. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   
   The app will open at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
